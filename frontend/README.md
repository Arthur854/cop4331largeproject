To clone the repo follow these steps if using Windows:

create a folder to store the project
open a terminal in that folder

run the following commands from that folder:

npm update
npm install nodejs
npm cache clean -f
npm install -g nodemon
npm create vite@latest -> select react -> select typescript

Now, clone the repo to a separate folder
copy paste the entire contents of the repo folder into the original folder you made (where you ran the commands)
delete the downloaded repo folder - go to Github Desktop and remove it from there when it asks
Now add the folder with all the files to your Github Desktop
